# Flashcard-app

Fabricated a react app that allows students to create decks that contain flashcards in which they can add or edit. The user may also delete a deck or a single card. While the app is in the study mode the student can flip the card to look at the answer then once flipped, they may hit the next card button, once they go through all the cards they have an option to restart the study session or return to home.

To make this app I had to use React's useState and useEffects methods to render the decks/cards information from the api functions that were provided. I also used the React's route to change the url when the user wanted to access a different page.

Built with JavaScript, React, CSS.
